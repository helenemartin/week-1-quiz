Weekly quiz
===========

It is expected that you will not have time to answer all questions. Try to answer at least one question from each section. (Questions nearer the top of each section are more important to know.)

Ruby basics
-----------

1) Describe the following ruby objects:
for instance [1,2,3] would be "an array containing three elements, the integer 1, the integer 2 and the integer 3"
and "" would be "a blank string"


1a) :crocodile a symbol

1b) "145.73" integer turned into a string?

1c) { :coffee => "cafe" } hash with key or value key

1d) [ :green, :eggs, :ham ] array with symbol (a collection?)(serialisation?)

1e) ["tea", {"juice" => "orange"}] block

2) Here is an array:
array = ["Molly", "Greg", "Taz"]
Write a line of ruby that appends the values "Jay" and "Mona" to the array.
[“Molly”, “greg”, “Taz”}.push(“Jay”)

3) Here is a hash:
hash = { :cow => "Moo", :sheep => "Baah" }
Write a line of ruby that replaces the value of the key :sheep with "Bleat".
detect_sheep(“sheep”)
=>”Bleat”

4) The file number_converter.rb contains a method called convert_number that doesn't do anything.

Replace the #??? comment inside it so that:
  if the argument passed is greater than 5, it returns 3 times the number,
  and if it is less than or equal to 5 it returns the number minus 3.
number = 0

if number>5
  puts "#{number} less than 5"
else number <= 5
  puts "#{number greater than 7"

end
end

5) Write a method that takes one argument (an array full of strings) and `puts` each word separately, but in uppercase.
str = “pi, pa,po”
puts str.split( /,/).uppercase

6) What's the difference between an object and an instance?
InStance never changes and is in Capital letter, an object is amendable

Testing
-------
7) robot.rb contains a simple class with two methods. robot_spec.rb is the start of a spec file - it runs, but there aren't any tests in it.

a) Write a test that checks greet('Ada') returns the string "HELLO ADA".
b) Write a test that checks calculate(4, 5) returns 9.
c) Write a test that checks calculate(5, 'horse') returns 5.
DON”T KNOW HOW TO DO THHHHAT TIME RUNNED OU

8) Explain the difference between the rspec methods let and subject.
let and subject is fast to create put is not repeatable whereas RSPEC is lengthy and to tedious to create but is more “sustainable” and if it is good, you may use it for a while

HTML, CSS and Javascript
------------------------

8) In a sentance, describe:
a) what is HTML?
 Hyper Marked Up Language for creating web pages on the World Wide Web
b) what is CSS? 
Cascading Style sheets, style sheets used to define how to present HTML elements
c) what is Javascript? 
object-oriented programming that interacts with the browser and makes HTML pages responsive

9) State if the following lines are HTML, CSS,or Javascript:

a) <p>Lorem Ipsum</p> HTML

b) console.log("Some words"); Javascript

c) p { background-color: yellow } Css

d) <table width="50%"></table> html

e) <div id="index" class="small left"></div> html

10) Describe the following Javascript objects, like you did for the first question:

10a) 100.26 integer

10b) "Hello" string

10c) [ "a", 4, null ] array

10d) { height: "180cm" } block
